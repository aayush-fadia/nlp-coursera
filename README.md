# Natural Language Processing Basics
### Two of my assignments from the [Natural Language Processing Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/language-processing) on Coursera.
* #### Named Entity Recognition using Bidirectional LSTMs
  - Used Bidirectional LSTMs to perform named entity recognition on a dataset of tweets.
  - Then thoroughly analysed the model to check where it failed, and why.
  - Entities included: Company Names, Person Names, Locations, Music Artists, TV Shows, and others.
  - Learned how neural networks can model sequences, and what having a bidirectional flow of information brings to the table.
* #### Addition and Subtraction using Seq2Seq
  - Framed addition and subtraction as a sequence to sequence task, then trained an encoder-decoder architecture to give a result number when given a basic, two operand addition or subtraction as an input.
  - Learned about Seq2Seq tasks, their strengths and limitations, and how to actually implement one in code.
